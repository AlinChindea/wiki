## Where do we teach?

Collabor8te, 22 Montrose St, Glasgow G1 1RE
https://g.page/Collabor8te?share

## When do we teach?

Every Saturday, 11am - 5pm.

## Lunch?

We get a donation from [Pret a Manger](https://www.pret.co.uk/) for each Saturday class but we also very much welcome mentors and students bringing along their own food! Food is brought by those mentors and students who wish to do so and shared amongst everyone—there is no requirement to bring food, but it’s a nice way to contribute.
