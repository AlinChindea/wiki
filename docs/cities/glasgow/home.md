## Class structure

Our Saturday class is normally held at [Collabor8te](https://collabor8te.co.uk/) ([22 Montrose Street, G1 1RE](https://goo.gl/maps/C6aFxhqyvqz)) between 11am and 5pm, including a 1 hour lunch break.
We get a donation from [Pret a Manger](https://www.pret.co.uk/) for each Saturday class but we also very much welcome mentors and students bringing along their own food!
Food is brought by those mentors and students who wish to do so and shared amongst everyone—there is no requirement to bring food, but it’s a nice way to contribute.

Please understand and follow the [house rules](../../students/house-rules.md) for the classes.

## Calendar

We are currently working against this [CYF Scotland calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Y29kZXlvdXJmdXR1cmUuaW9fYmswNDFocTNkdm9zdjBidmdkN2wwb2lwY2tAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) to track sessions and events.
Here’s the same [calendar in iCal format](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/codeyourfuture.io_bk041hq3dvosv0bvgd7l0oipck%40group.calendar.google.com/private-6eb101d8a2bc2ef98073e6875d9c0216/basic.ics).
Make sure you tick CYF Scotland on the sidebar of your desktop calendar app to see it.

## Module structure

We split our course into modules, consisting of 3 weeks of material taught every Saturday followed by a revision week where mentors and students are not required to meet up on a Saturday.

At the end of each module, we run a retrospective and take actions based on the students' feedback.

## Homework

Students receive around 15-20 hours of homework every week.

## Extra help

Mid-week face to face meetings and online sessions are also regularly organised between mentors and students to help with homework.
This is done on an ad-hoc basis and on days, times and venues arranged between those taking part in the arrangement.

## Communication

All our communication is done on [Slack](https://slack.com/).
Please read the [Slack page](../../volunteers/slack-volunteers.md) for information on how we use it.
