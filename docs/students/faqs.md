## Questions

### Is this course recognised by employers?

Most jobs don't ask for a degree, however, more and more companies recognize CYF courses as a Full Stack Development bootcamp as bootcamps in general are becoming a more popular way to study as a developer.

### Do we have any Saturday’s off during school half term break or Easter or during the summer?

Yes, we have some time off for holidays. You should speak to your course coordinator or teachers to find our when they are.

### Do I need to be good at maths?

Maths is not as important in development as many people think it is. The computer can do the maths for you, though it can be helpful to understand how and why a calculation is being carried out. Where necessary, we will also explain the maths involved in an exercise :) That being said, being good at maths or better at thinking more logically can work to your advantage. Different ways of thinking lead to different solutions!

### What is after the Fundamentals Course?

After finishing the Fundamental Course successfully, you will go through the main course, where you will start coding on your machine and the syllabus will start (https://syllabus.codeyourfuture.io/)

### How to build a personal network in coding industry?

It can be a good idea to get involved in the local coding meet ups and groups if you want to meet other people learning to code, or people who already work as developers. Some you can look into attending in Manchester are Code Up, codeandstuff, Barcamp, and local hackathons. We can create a list of events and groups for you all and share information about upcoming events when we hear about them too. During the course, we will be working with each of you on things like your CV, LinkedIn profiles, etc. and you can get some tips from our personal development team during these sessions.

### Do you need a certificate to become a developer?

No, most jobs ads don't ask for a degree. Some positions may ask for a degree, however, you can always apply as in some cases it's the company’s formal way of writing job positions.

### What is after CYF?

It depends on your goals. Most graduates seek employment, some seek further studies, however, the course will prepare you to find a job as a Full Stack Developer (in addition to technical material, CYF provides Personal Development hours through the course, writing CVs, LinkedIn account, Networking and more).

### How many days can the student absent?

#### Also: Can we request a day off in advance if needed?

We recommend you to attend all of the Saturday sessions in order to not miss the content we are teaching, but we understand that you may become ill, go on holiday, or need to take time off for things like childcare or emergencies. If you need to miss a Saturday class, this is okay, but understand that we will expect you to study to catch up. We will contact you if you miss a class and explain what you have missed, but we won’t have time to teach the whole class again the next week, as the rest of the class will need to keep progressing. We trust that you will attend unless there’s a good reason you can’t come. If you miss many classes, you are likely to start falling behind, in which case we will talk with you about whether you are taking the course seriously.

## Will I be able to use Khan academy after the course finishes?

Yes, all online course sites we will use through the course will be free including (Coursera, CodeAcademy, etc)
