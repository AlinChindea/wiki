## Editing

### Get Added to Github Teams

#### Code Your Future Teams

We use Github Teams to securely edit and update the Wiki. The broadest level team that you can be a part of it [Mentors](https://github.com/orgs/CodeYourFuture/teams/mentors) but many of the sub-teams will also work.

If you do not have access to edit the wiki please speak to a staff member or volunteer and ask them to add you [the Mentors group](https://github.com/orgs/CodeYourFuture/teams/mentors).

#### Other People

If you are not a member of Code Your Future, you are welcome to make a change but we ask that you Fork this repository and open a pull request.

### Editing a Page

At the top of every page in this wiki there is a small `Edit` button. Clicking this button will take you to Github.

When you reach Github you will see a small `Pen` button that looks like this:
![Edit Github](assets/contribution-guide/editgithub.png)

Clicking the `Pen` button will take you to this `Editing Screen`:
![Edit Page Github](assets/contribution-guide/editpagegithub.png)

When you've made your changes, scroll to the bottom of the screen and click the `Commit` button.

You changes will then be made public on the Wiki within 1-2 minutes
