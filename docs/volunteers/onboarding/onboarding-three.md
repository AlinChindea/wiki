Once you have completed your general onboarding tasks, you should be invited to a team meeting. 

You should be invited to the main CYF Slack workspace too - along with some of the other tools below (depending on your team)  
- Slack
  - All the channels associated with your city
    - e.g.
      - \#scotland channel
      - \#scotland-mentors channel
      - \#scotland-class-4 channel
      - \#scotland-education / \#scotland-development-and-outreach channel
      - @scotlandmentors user list
- GitHub
  - City mentors group, so that you can review PRs and collaborate on the syllabus
- Trello
  - Used for assessment of homework and graduation project work, and also used sometimes for other things like outreach
- Google Calendar and Group
  - To receive updates and changes for class dates, times and locations (please tell us when you no longer want to receive updates)
Please let us know either on Slack or through your cities contact information if you have not been added to any of the above.
