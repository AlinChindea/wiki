Once you have attended your first onboarding session, you should receive an invitation to a Slack workspace for new volunteers (also where new Applicants are). 

During your first training session, you will learn about the first volunteering tasks at CodeYourFuture. 

To do a task, click the Lighting bolt button in the Fellowship Slack channel. You will receive a link in your Slack Direct messages from the Slackbot with the instructions.
