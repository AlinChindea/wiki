**Contacting NGOS and other referral organiations**

If have an NGO list in your city (in the CYF General G-drive in Outreach > NGO - lists) - skip ahead to point 3. For G-drive access, ask your induction coordinator. 

1. Research and collate contact details of a significant number of charities, NGOs, educational establishments for adults, training centres, and community groups that work with refugees, asylum seekers, and other disadvantaged (i.e. low-income, disabilities etc.) 

As a starting point, we recommend at least 50 organisations, and ideally 100+ organisations. 
If CYF is already established in your city, this list may already exist. Contact your local organiser to provide a list of NGOs to call.

2. Upload these organisation into Google Spreadsheet in your city folder and organise them based on their relevance to the course - there will be signs to suggest that certain organisations or groups are more likely to provide suitable applicants for CYF than others. 

Prioritise those that you believe to be the most likely source of applicants. You can also check the top referrers in the applicant dashboard for this - by downloading referral data for your city. 

3. Start calling NGOs - based on those who referred before - if that data is available. 

4. Making a call takes around 10mins, and is best done during the day when the NGOs are open. Lunch times work well. 

5. The process is email > call > email any requested information. We send flyers because it organisations can print them out or and pass them onto students directly - it is a physical manifestation of an opportunity.

6. The first email can be sent from a CYF email address - perhaps by an active member of the outreach team. Volunteers then follow up that email with a call - ensuring the right contact at the NGO is contacted. 

7. Volunteers update the list with the next steps, eg. Jo from Refuaid wants more details. The project organiser - with a CYF email address - can follow up on the info requests from the NGOs.

8. Then, call the NGOs back within a month! NGOs are often busy doing other things, so a second call, especailly to big referrers, is critical. 

**Material for calling NGOs**
- The NGO list can be found in the CYF General G-drive in Outreach > NGO - lists
- Applicant Flyers can be found on the CYF G-drive in the Outreach > Flyers
- Emails can be found on the CYF G-drive in Outreach > Emails
- For G-drive access, ask your induction coordinator!

**Calling Applicants**

There are three stages for an applicant:

- An online course - tutorials and the creation of mini web projects. If they succeed in this, they are invited for an interview (if they pass the eligability criteria. These tutorials and mini projects usually take a few weeks - longer if people haven't coded before: https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/volunteers/application-process. 
- A fundamentals intensive - a month long, with classes on the weekends: https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/volunteers/fundamentals
- The full 8-month course: https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/volunteers/the-course

While the applicants are working on the tutorials, it is important at this time to call an applicant and ensure that they are clear about the process, are receiving emails and are actively working on the tutorials. 

Many applicants suffer from isolation and depression, so a call at this stage can provide a lot of motivation to students.

**Material for calling applicants**
- Call scripts can be found on the CYF G-drive in Outreach > Scripts

**Facebook Groups**

- Research relevant Facebook groups. A lot of disadvantaged people join communities on Facebook for their geographical location i.e. Iraqi Refugees in London etc. These are great sources of applicants.

- Work with your local organisers to get access to the list of previously used Facebook Groups for your region / country.  

**Word of mouth**

- Use the CYF Slack channels! Post in your city and general channels when the drop ins are due to start. Of the last 110 people who completed step 1 in London - 50% came from word of mouth! 

**Workshops**

- Make sure the events calendar on codeyourfuture has the next workshop dates. Create an eventbrites and invite applicants to these coding workshops.
