**Contacting NGOS and other referral organiations**

- Research and collate contact details of a significant number of charities, NGOs, educational establishments for adults, training centres, and community groups that work with refugees, asylum seekers, and other disadvantaged (i.e. low-income, disabilities etc.) 

- As a starting point, we recommend at least 50 organisations, and ideally 100+ organisations. 
If CYF is already established in your city, this list may already exist. Contact your local organiser to provide a list of NGOs to call.

- Upload these organisation into Google Spreadsheet in your city folder and organise them based on their relevance to the course - there will be signs to suggest that certain organisations or groups are more likely to provide suitable applicants for CYF than others. 

- Prioritise those that you believe to be the most likely source of applicants. You can also check the top referrers in the applicant dashboard for this - by downloading referral data for your city. 

- Get help calling - ask the leaders of the other volunteering teams to help you call everyone on the list. This will happen in sprints.

- The process is email > call > email any requested information. We send flyers because it organisations can print them out or and pass them onto students directly - it is a physical manifestation of an opportunity.

- Then, call the NGOs back within a month! NGOs are often busy doing other things, so a second call, especailly to big referrers, is critical. 

**Material**
- Applicant Flyers can be found on the CYF G-drive in the Outreach > Flyers
- Emails can be found on the CYF G-drive in Outreach > Emails
- For G-drive access, ask your coordinator. 

**Drop ins**

- Check the calendar for the next Drop-in date. Create an eventbrite and invite applicants to drop in sessions. 

**Facebook Groups**

- Research relevant Facebook groups. A lot of disadvantaged people join communities on Facebook for their geographical location i.e. Iraqi Refugees in London etc. These are great sources of applicants.

- Work with your local organisers to get access to the list of previously used Facebook Groups for your region / country.  

**Word of mouth**

- Use the CYF Slack channels! Post in your city and general channels when the drop ins are due to start. Of the last 110 people who completed step 1 in London - 50% came from word of mouth!
