## Recommended Zoom Settings for classroom hosts

There are two pages of settings to configure, with some duplication.

Link: [Scheduling a new meeting](https://zoom.us/meeting/schedule)

Pay particular attention to the following Meeting options:

- "Enable join before host" - `ON`
  - Otherwise, during the meeting you or a co-host will have to notice students trying to get in, and admit them one by one.
- Mute participants upon entry - `ON`
- Enable waiting room - `OFF`
  - This will silently override "Enable join before host" and will force you to manually admit students.

## General settings in profile

Link: [Settings](https://zoom.us/profile/setting)

- Join before host - `ON`
- Mute participants upon entry - `ON`
- Chat - `ON`
- Auto saving chats - `ON`
  - However, be aware zoom chat is inferior, and you might want to encourage important chat messages to go elsewhere
- Play sound when participants join or leave - `ON`
  - To the host at least. This can be turned off during the meeting (at least with desktop client)
- Display end-of-meeting experience feedback survey - `ON`
- Co-host - `ON`
- Polling - `ON`
  - Allow host to put attendee on hold - `ON`
    - As a workaround for better breakout auto-distribution (see recommendations)
- Who can share? - `All participants`
- Annotation - `ON`
- Auto-save whiteboard when meeting is stopped: `ON`
- Remote-control: `ON`
- Nonverbal feedback: `ON`
- In Meeting (advanced)
  - Breakout room - `ON`
- Allow host to assign participants to breakout rooms when scheduling: `ON`
  - I like randomisation, but this will have its uses
- Virtual background - `OFF`
  - Fun but may slow old laptops down without students understanding why
- Attention tracking - `ON`
- Waiting room - `OFF`
- Show a "Join from your browser" lin - `ON`
  - The browser experience is very good
- Email notification... When attendees join meeting before host: `OFF`
  - Otherwise you'll get 40 emails even if you're a minute late.
- Allow removed participants to rejoin- `ON`
