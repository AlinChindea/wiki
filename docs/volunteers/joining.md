## How can I join?

You can join as a volunteer by filling out a [volunteer form on our website](https://codeyourfuture.io/volunteers/).

## When can I join?

You can join anytime as there is always something you can help out with all year round.

## What can I do?

This is a non-exhaustive list of things you can help out with:

- Helping to answer student's questions during classes
- Helping to teach a part or all of a class
- Reviewing student homework on GitHub
- Helping out students outside of classes, either in person or on Slack
- Helping students during their graduation coding project
- Organising social events
- Helping specific teams, which involves working towards the goals outlined in the [volunteer teams page](volunteers/teams.md) through regular communication and meetings with other mentors

Volunteers are not expected to come to every weekend Saturday class and to do all of the above, but you are more than welcome to if you would like!

## What if I don't know JavaScript/React/Node?

In the first few months, the focus is on logical thinking and teaching programming concepts common across many languages such as variables, loops, and functions so you can definitely provide help to students despite not knowing JavaScript.

Later in the course, the students learn frameworks such as React, Node and Express.
If you are not familiar with these frameworks, you might still be able to pick them up quickly as they are taught in class.
You can still be of help to students as mistakes are made at the syntax and logical level where knowledge of the framework is not required.
