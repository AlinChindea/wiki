title: Homework Feedback

Giving effective, actionable feedback is one of the ways that we can best help our students learn and grow.

## Quickly Giving Feedback

**Visual Studio Github Plug-in**

The VS Code studio plug-in can help speed up moving between pull requests and making comments.

https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pull-request-github

It allows you to make comments from directly inside and VS Code and allows each comparision between Pull Requests.

**Github Desktop**

Using Github Desktop makes it easy to see all of the open pull requests for a Repository and move quickly between them.

Simply navigate to the Branch tab at the top of the screen then select the Pull Request tab

## Giving Feedback

Feedback should be given directly on the Pull Request that the students create on the exercise repository. 

When you have given the student feedback it is useful if you tag the Pull Request as having been `Reviewed`

If the homework has not been completed or if there is a major problem with the homework then mark it as `Invalid`

## Feedback Advice

**Be Positive**

Above all else be positive and be kind. Our students want to learn and want to understand. 

You should pull out small wins from bad code and encourage them to continue and try again. Many of our students suffer from low confidence and a well timed comment of motivation can be all it takes to push them to success. 

If in doubt, consult our [key rules](volunteers/education/teaching-rules). 

**Directing to Resources**

If you can tell that a student has been struggling with a particular area of the homework one key way that you can help is to 

1. Acknowledge that they have struggled 
2. Re-assure them that many people struggle with such problems
3. Direct them to an online resource that will help them understand the problem better

We should try to shy away from writing long, complex explanations to students problems. This can be a time sink, especially when great resources already exist.

*Please note*: Do not just link to documentation! Link to a tutorial or guide that explains the documentation.

**Fixing Bugs**

If the bug is a simple compilation or formatting error it's perfectly fine to suggest a fix to the issue. For example, an incorrect relative URL is a simple error that does not imply a deeper misunderstanding of the content and so can be safely fixed.

**Prompting to Ask Questions**

Make every error a teaching moment, mention that you see other students struggling with the same concepts and that asking questions on Slack can be a way to remedy their problems.

**Explaining an Obvious Mental Model Issue**

When a student implements code in a way that seems nonsensical the root cause can often be a misconception in how they have built their [mental model](https://teachtogether.tech/#s:models). If you can obviously tell from their homework what their misunderstanding is then you are encouraged to correct them. 

If they seem to fundamentally misunderstand a concept then it is best to refer them back to the source material.

**Formatting**

It never hurts to hammer home the importance of proper formatting and indentation

## Homework Grading

For our records and to track student progress it is important that we track how well the student is progressing through our course. This can happen in a variety of places.

- Class Tracking Spreadsheet
- Google Classroom
- Trello Cards

Please consult your Class Coordinators for the best place to record this information as it will vary from class to class.

Grades should be given on the follow criteria

- The completeness of the homework
- How much you believe the student understands the content
- How well executed the homework is

This is, above all else, an indicator of the students abilities and is not comprehensive. Different teachers will grade homework at different levels and we should be aware of this. 

## Suspicion of Copying

We take attempts of plagiarisation very seriously at Code Your Future because it is a strong indicator that the student is out of their depth and do not understand key concepts.

If you suspect a student has copied code please report this back to the Education Team and Course Coordinator on Slack. You should also highlight their homework as being `Invalid`.
