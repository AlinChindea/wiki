title: History of Code Your Future
---

The idea behind CodeYourFuture started brewing during the summer of 2016 when Germán, while working in the tech industry, was looking for a way to create a positive impact in people's lives through technology.

During his job he had the chance to travel all around Europe meeting founders of tech companies and he had seen how valuable developers were for organisations of any size and how hard it was to find people with the right skills. At the same time the European refugee crisis of 2015 had left UK with a general negative perception of forcibly displaced people and society was arguing about the the dreams and aspirations of people about people that most society had never made acquientance or met.

One day Germán came across an dutch organisation called [HackYourFuture](https://www.hackyourfuture.net/) (HYF) that was training refugees in tech skills through volunteer developers and help them find employment in the industry. The idea was inspirational, so he went to find an equivalent organisation in the UK that was offering a similar program for refugees. He didn't find any. Then he contacted Gijs Cortens, the founder of HYF and he became a guide on the early stages of the process. He brought a focus on testing the demand an find applicants. Germán then started compiling a list of around hundred NGOs/organisations that worked with asylum seekers and refugees and started reaching out to all of them.
