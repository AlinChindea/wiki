## Getting attention when you have a problem

Here are some ways you should communicate if you have technical problems
 * Open "participants" and click the "No" button
 * Raise your hand on camera or make a "thumbs down", on camera.  Hold it there.
 * Write your problem on Slack

Most importantly, listen to your teachers for the ways *they* want you to communicate problems.
