Ice-breakers, Energizers, Fun, Silliness

# Fun activities for the remote classroom

Generally, gallery-view is best for these, or if also screensharing, gallery-view with `view-options`: `side-by-side`

### "Sound-check Story-time" (word at a time / phrase at a time) (Tag: EnglishPractice)

Tell a silly story a phrase at a time, or a word at a time.

A good way to test everyone's microphone briefly, and for the teachers to refresh their memory of student and TA names.

Example of play:
* Neill: "Once upon a time there was a frog who lived in a pond... Ali?"
* Ali: "her name was Abigail.  She always dreamed of being a... Sabia?"
* Sabia: "...uhmm airline pilot?  ...Mohsen?"
* Mohsen: "Every day the frog would go for a swim, and eat flies.  But one day... Anna?"
* Anna: "Yikes!  Pass!  Roberta?"
* Roberta: "...but one day the frog..."
* and so on

Notes, ideas:
* It is VERY ok to pass
* This is not recommended for a new class or any other students who might feel awkward - that's counter-productive.
* Larger classes can do this in breakout rooms
* Can be done in breakout rooms for more turns per player, less waiting
* students might be interested in [22 rules of storytelling according to pixar](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-22-rules-of-storytelling-according-to-pixar-5916970)

Extras: Choose a setting: 
  * I'd love if we happen to meet a shark
  * Or three elements: "Nima, Martyna, Laurie - what would you like to be mentioned in this story? a place?  a thing? a desire?... " (wait as all three think of a topic each) announced simultaneously... "pirates" "paris" "accountants"
    * you can assign them individually to these categories so that we get one of each (e.g. adjective noun verb, or thing, place, desire)

Extra: use [rory's story cubes](https://www.storycubes.com/en/) or similar, as lubricant.  You can use the app and screenshare it from phone to the zoom call. 

Variants:
**Word-at-a-time**: This is great but requires the students know the running order or is too slow.  
  * That order can come from...
    * the participants view
    * a screen-share of a text doc with everyone's name on it
    * the gallery view (but they may not all be able to see it, and get lost paginating)
  * prep: prepare a slide with a list of the students names, to be followed during the word-at-a-time variant
  * Kick-start the game with: "once"

 


### Selfies

Take a selfie with everyone in it (who wants to be)

* Give plenty of notice for those who don't want to be in it to leave the shot or turn off their cameras
* choose a photographer: someone who knows how to screenshot
* Use the gallery view (On faster computers you can get up to 50 faces per screen)
* "photographer" should turn off "always show names" in their client settings, for more privacy.
* ask for cheesey smiles [here are some "dad jokes"](https://www.livin3.com/100-bad-dad-jokes-that-will-make-you-laugh-or-cringe)
* photographer should give clear countdown

Variants:
* everyone shows an object, or [fingerspells](http://www.british-sign.co.uk/fingerspelling-alphabet-charts/) something ("Coding", "CYF"?)

### Present an important object
* everyone goes and fetches an important/interesting object
* presents on it for 10-30 seconds
* intersperse student presentations with volunteer presentations
* optional: 1/2 way, reflect what made a good presentation (perhaps energy, personalisation, the WHY, humour, object close-up view & lighting)

This can be done in breakout rooms, for big classes.

### Madlibs

### Articulate (tag: LanguagePractice)
[BGG](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6541/articulate)

PD are building lists of technical concepts to use in this game

### Taboo (tag: LanguagePractice)
[BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1111/taboo)
Most times you just want to play articulate

### Charades (tag: LanguagePractice)

### Telestrations / Eat poop you cat

My favourite game IRL.  Looks like there's a free implementation here https://drawception.com/register/ but I haven't tried it.

### Psychiatrist / Off Your Rocker
[BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/120814/your-rocker)

* needs a class who are ready for silliness and trust each other

### Pictionary
* Use the share: whiteboard feature
* Have "players" use annotation to draw on the whiteboard ("`view options`: `annotate`, next to "viewing jo smith's screen"

### Snapchat faces: silly
Well-known volunteers present their face distorted by snapchat "lenses", perhaps apparently while attempting to lecture seriously.

prep:
One or more well-known volunteers:
* install zoom on phone
* install snapchat on phone
* join the zoom call on phone (mute laptop to avoid feedback squeal, unmute on phone)
* share screen
* start snapchat
* tap once on your face to scan it
* choose lens

This is a good time for natural selfies: the photographer can use `gallery view` and `side-by-side` from view options

### Walk around - tour by phone
* Join the call on your phones and give a tour of your house

### 5-minute Photo competition
Everyone has 5-10 minutes to take and share a photo of something (according to a prompt)
some prompts: 
view from your window | favourite book | a toy/game |  sunset | something the colour [orange]

More detail:
Sharing on slack would work: in a specific thread.

variants: 
* instead of photos:
  * draw a picture 
    * in real life, and photo it
    * online using zoom annotations
  * draw pixel art (e.g. with [piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/)
    * use a collab drawing tool

### Drawing together

Everyone collaborates to draw a picture, based on a prompt

Use Zoom's share:whiteboard, and annotations.
Or an online collab website

* Beware not everyone has access to annotations. not inclusive.

### Keep talking and nobody explodes
Stressful, but excellent teamwork exercise likely to generate a situation for study very quickly.

For some people, this shouldn't be in the "fun" category

Website: [keep talking and nobody explodes](https://keeptalkinggame.com/) - 

Extra thoughts: With students' permission, videoing these exercises in small groups, and watching them back (after cool-down), while perhaps painful, can quickly show comms breakdown or good practices.  Be careful to burn the videos after watching, agent!
