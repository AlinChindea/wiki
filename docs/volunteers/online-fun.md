# Fun activities for the remote classroom

Generally, gallery-view is best for these, or if also screensharing, gallery-view with `view-options`: `side-by-side`

### "Story-time sound-check" (word at a time / phrase at a time) (Tag: EnglishPractice)

Tell a silly story a phrase at a time, or a word at a time.

A good way to test everyone's microphone briefly, and for the teachers to refresh their memory of student and TA names.

Example of play:
* Neill: "Once upon a time there was a frog who lived in a pond... Ali?"
* Ali: "her name was Abigail.  She always dreamed of being a... Sabia?"
* Sabia: "...uhmm airline pilot?  ...Mohsen?"
* Mohsen: "Every day the frog would go for a swim, and eat flies.  But one day... Anna?"
* Anna: "Yikes!  Pass!  Roberta?"
* Roberta: "...but one day the frog..."
* and so on

Notes, ideas:
* It is VERY ok to pass
* This is not recommended for a new class or any other students who might feel awkward - that's counter-productive.
* Larger classes can do this in breakout rooms
* Can be done in breakout rooms for more turns per player, less waiting

Variant:
* word-at-a-time: This is great but requires the students know the running order or is too slow.  That order can come from...
* the participants view
* a screen-share of a text doc with everyone's name on it
* the gallery view (but they may not all be able to see it, and get lost paginating)
* prep: prepare a slide with a list of the students names, to be followed during the word-at-a-time variant


### Selfies
* gallery view.  on a better processor you can get up to 50 faces.
* "photographer" should turn off "always show names" in their client settings, for more privacy.

### Present an important object
* everyone goes and fetches an important/interesting object
* presents on it for 10-30 seconds
* intersperse student presentations with volunteer presentations
* optional: 1/2 way, reflect what made a good presentation (perhaps energy, personalisation, the WHY, humour, object close-up view & lighting)

This can be done in breakout rooms, for big classes.


### Articulate


### Pictionary
* Use the share: whiteboard feature
* Have "players" use annotation to draw on the whiteboard ("`view options`: `annotate`, next to "viewing jo smith's screen"


### Snapchat faces: silly
Well-known volunteers present their face distorted by snapchat "lenses", perhaps apparently while attempting to lecture seriously.

prep:
One or more well-known volunteers:
* install zoom on phone
* install snapchat on phone
* join the zoom call on phone (mute laptop to avoid feedback squeal, unmute on phone)
* share screen
* start snapchat
* tap once on your face to scan it
* choose lens

This is a good time for natural selfies: the photographer can use `gallery view` and `side-by-side` from view options

### Walk around - tour by phone
* Join the call on your phones and give a tour of your house

### 5-minute Photo competition
Everyone has 5-10 minutes to take and share a photo of something (according to a prompt)
some prompts: 
view from your window | favourite book | a toy/game |  sunset | something the colour [orange]

More detail:
Sharing on slack would work: in a specific thread.

variants: 
* instead of photos:
  * draw a picture 
    * in real life, and photo it
    * online using zoom annotations
  * draw pixel art (e.g. with [piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/)
    * use a collab drawing tool

### Drawing together

Everyone collaborates to draw a picture, based on a prompt

Use Zoom's share:whiteboard, and annotations.
Or an online collab website

* Beware not everyone has access to annotations. not inclusive.

# To elaborate

* [keep talking and nobody explodes](https://keeptalkinggame.com/) - stressful, but excellent exercise to study teamworking
* jackbox.tv e.g. drawful 2 (most games limited to 10)
