# Fun activities for the remote classroom

Ice-breakers, Energizers, puzzles, entertainments, Fun, Silliness

# Work needed on this page:
I'll move the activities into sections (or otherwise tag them) so that it's clear which activities have been tested and are recommended.

Other data are: group size (min, ideal, max), new-class suitability, run time, EnlishLanguagePractice, GoodEnglishLanguageRequirement, 



## Game and activity ideas which are ready now - tested, trusted

Generally, gallery-view is best for these, or if also screensharing, gallery-view with `view-options`: `side-by-side`

### "Sound-check Story-time" (word at a time / phrase at a time) (Tag: EnglishPractice)

Tell a silly story a phrase at a time, or a word at a time.

A good way to test everyone's microphone briefly, and for the teachers to refresh their memory of student and TA names.

Example of play:
* Neill: "Once upon a time there was a frog who lived in a pond... Ali?"
* Ali: "her name was Abigail.  She always dreamed of being a... Sabia?"
* Sabia: "...uhmm airline pilot?  ...Mohsen?"
* Mohsen: "Every day the frog would go for a swim, and eat flies.  But one day... Anna?"
* Anna: "Yikes!  Pass!  Roberta?"
* Roberta: "...but one day the frog..."
* and so on

Notes, ideas:
* It is VERY ok to pass, offer the possibility if someone is choking
* This is not recommended for a new class or any other students who might feel awkward - that's counter-productive.
* Can also be done in breakout rooms for more turns per player, less waiting, particularly for larger classes
* Students might be interested in [22 rules of storytelling according to pixar](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-22-rules-of-storytelling-according-to-pixar-5916970)
* Ask one or two volunteers or extrovert students first, to get the game rolling.
* MC must maintain an energy
* MC can repeat/recap the story at points if it's suspected forgotten

Extra: use [rory's story cubes](https://www.storycubes.com/en/) or similar online story prompts, as lubricant.  You can use the storycubes app and screenshare it from phone to the zoom call. 

Extras: Choose a setting: 
  * I'd love if we happen to meet a shark
  * Or three elements: "Nima, Martyna, Laurie - what would you like to be mentioned in this story? a place?  a thing? a desire?... " (wait as all three think of a topic each) announced simultaneously... "pirates" "paris" "accountants"
    * you can assign them individually to these categories so that we get one of each (e.g. adjective noun verb, or thing, place, desire)

Variants:
**Word-at-a-time**: This is great but requires the students know the running order or is too slow.  
  * That order can come from...
    * the participants view
    * a screen-share of a text doc with everyone's name on it
    * the gallery view (but they may not all be able to see it, and get lost paginating)
  * prep: prepare a slide with a list of the students names, to be followed during the word-at-a-time variant
  * Kick-start the game with: "once"

### Selfies (feel-good)

Take a selfie with everyone in it (who wants to be)

* Give plenty of notice for those who don't want to be in it to leave the shot or turn off their cameras
* choose a photographer: someone who knows how to screenshot
* Use the gallery view (On faster computers you can get up to 50 faces per screen)
* "photographer" should turn off "always show names" in their client settings, for more privacy.
* ask for cheesey smiles [here are some "dad jokes"](https://www.livin3.com/100-bad-dad-jokes-that-will-make-you-laugh-or-cringe)
* photographer should give clear countdown
* optional: collect the selfies, to make a book through the course. (simple website)

Variants:
* everyone shows an object, or [fingerspells](http://www.british-sign.co.uk/fingerspelling-alphabet-charts/) something ("Coding", "CYF"?)

Privacy
* Give people a quiet, easy way out of the selfie
* Don't take photos with participant names on them 

work-needed:
volunteer to identify / design a good place for all the selfies


### Present an object

This activity is of a pattern: **Find, process, present, collect**

* everyone goes and fetches an important/interesting object
* presents on it for 10-30 seconds
* intersperse student presentations with volunteer presentations
* optional: 1/2 way, reflect what made a good presentation (perhaps energy, personalisation, the WHY, humour, object close-up view & lighting)
* optional: collection of photos for everyone's object, as a memento?

This can be done in breakout rooms, for big classes.

### Articulate (tag: LanguagePractice)
[BGG](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6541/articulate)

PD are building lists of technical concepts to use in this game

### Taboo (tag: LanguagePractice)
[BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1111/taboo)
Most times you just want to play articulate

### Charades (tag: LanguagePractice)

### Twenty-questions / animal/mineral/vegetable

Variants: see: "The Insider"

### The Insider

This is essentially twenty-questions but one person already knows the answer but wants to stay undercover.

[The Insider on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/206051/insider)

### Pictionary
* Use the share: whiteboard feature
* Have "players" use annotation to draw on the whiteboard ("`view options`: `annotate`, next to "viewing jo smith's screen"

### Snapchat faces: silly
Well-known volunteers present their face distorted by snapchat "lenses", perhaps apparently while attempting to lecture seriously.

prep:
One or more well-known volunteers:
* install zoom on phone
* install snapchat on phone
* join the zoom call on phone (mute laptop to avoid feedback squeal, unmute on phone)
* share screen
* start snapchat
* tap once on your face to scan it
* choose lens

This is a good time for natural selfies: the photographer can use `gallery view` and `side-by-side` from view options

### Game: Empires / Families / Chappie Tomato
https://youthgroupgames.com.au/games/698/empires/

To allow for the grouping that happens (normally physically), an assistant to edit a shared google doc with everyone's name on it to show the empire statuses:

* Ahmad
* Barney
* Candy
* Daniel

Then if Barney guesses daniel's word, he becomes king of an empire of two:

* Ahmad
* Barney, Daniel
* Candy

He gets to guess again, but guesses candy's word wrong.

Candy gets a turn and guesses Ahmad correctly. 

* Candy, Ahmad
* Barney, Daniel

She can't remember the last word, and Ahmad (who is allowed to help her, can't rember either)
GM times them out after 30 seconds.

Barney remembers what candy must be and wins:

* Barney, Daniel, Candy, Ahmad

### Find the cutest animal on google images (equipment-test, Screen-sharing, training search & image-saving)

This activity is of a pattern: **Find, process, present, collect**

This simple warm-up / equipment test activity just gives a simple task to focus on rather than only asking the students "test your screen-share".  The choice can allow for some expression, too.

* go to breakouts
* say hi to each other
* individually find something as requested
  * e.g. All find a cute (or interesting) animal picture on google images
* (optional) as a group do some processing on it (e.g. add it to a gallery / playlist)
* help each other make sure everyone has managed to find a thing and do the optional processing
* return to main
* share with the class
* (optionally) class collect the works, with attribution, to make permanent artifacts

In simplest form, this doesn't need to be done in breakout groups, but with 20 students, the same few people will dominate the conversation. In breakout groups (I suggest random groups) it gives more people a chance to chat.

Variants: 
* find a song you love on youtube (collect into a playlist)
* find a picture of a work of art you love
* find a poem you love
* ...


### Madlibs


### Telestrations / Eat poop you cat

My favourite game IRL.  Looks like there's a free implementation here https://drawception.com/register/ but I haven't tried it.

### Psychiatrist / Off Your Rocker
[BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/120814/your-rocker)

* needs a class who are ready for silliness and trust each other

### Make a recipe book:

Collect a recipe book together with all our favourite recipes (ideally, 2 each)

* Into plain text in github
* later into json, **validated!**
* later rendered in react app (react module)
* later into an [API in node module](https://cyf-recipes-reading-exercise.glitch.me/recipes/1)

The trouble with the later stages of this is the (relative) complexity of the (ideal) data model for real recipes, but we can keep it simple.

### Find a funny joke, come back and tell it
* Breakout rooms, say 4 ppl each.
* Individually find one joke each, and share them with each other in the 4
* Decide the best 1-2 jokes
* Back at main, one team-member tells the joke on mic, another team-member types it into a list in text chat.
* Two students volunteer to collect the jokes and send them to the other cities on slack after.  Action one TA to check it gets done.
    * perhaps the students put them into a webpage (codepen/glitch) or hosted on ghpages/netlify (~ CYF-best-jokes.com). another github repo...


### Walk around - tour by phone (breakout suitable)
* Join the call on your phones and give a tour of your house
* can be assigned in advance to those students who want to try it
* never mandatory: students might not want to show their conditions, or perhaps even their location

### 5-minute Photo competition
Everyone has 5-10 minutes to take and share a photo of something (according to a prompt)
some prompts: 
view from your window | favourite book | a toy/game |  sunset | something the colour [orange]

More detail:
Sharing on slack would work: in a specific thread.

variants: 
* instead of photos:
  * draw a picture 
    * in real life, and photo it
    * online using zoom annotations
  * draw pixel art (e.g. with [piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/)
    * use a collab drawing tool

### Drawing together (breakout-suitable)

Everyone collaborates to draw a picture, based on a prompt

Use Zoom's share:whiteboard, and annotations.
Or an online collab website

* Beware not everyone has access to annotations. not inclusive.

### Keep talking and nobody explodes
Stressful, but excellent teamwork exercise likely to generate a situation for study very quickly.

For some people, this shouldn't be in the "fun" category

Website: [keep talking and nobody explodes](https://keeptalkinggame.com/) - 

Extra thoughts: With students' permission, videoing these exercises in small groups, and watching them back (after cool-down), while perhaps painful, can quickly show comms breakdown or good practices.  Be careful to burn the videos after watching, agent!

### Google Quick-Draw (Fun, one at a time, smaller groups, tests-screen-sharing)
One person at a time plays [Google QuickDraw](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/) while the others watch (passively) or perhaps give advice.

* One game takes 2 minutes, it's fun to watch.
* Can work in big group when people are relaxing - (e.g. on lunch)


### Sixes

[Sixes on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/177877/sixes)

A mellow pen and paper game which can encourage light discussion.  

Best with 6 players (4-8 is fine.)

This adaptation will benefit from everyone being visible on webcam for quick scoring.

Everyone simultaneously and secretly has (say) 2 minutes to write down (on real paper) 6 things of an announced category, attempting to choose the things other players will also have written down.

(*) They can write them on a piece of paper or in a local vscode doc.
Doesn't have to be six things.  but agree before.

##### Example of play:
* GM: "Ok, write down 4 famous London tourist attractions that you think other people will also write.  No talking, and NO asking clarifying questions!  4 famous things that tourists go to see when they come to London....  You have two minutes!"
... two minutes pass...

* Cesar has written 1) london eye, 2) big ben, 3) houses of parliament 4) st paul's cathedral
* Adalberto has written: 1) tower of london, 2) london eye 3) tussauds 4) buckingham palace
* Manolito has written: 1) london eye 2) tower of london 3) big ben 4) trafalgar sq

(continued below)
##### Scoring:

Everyone keeps their own score.  You get more points when more players have written the same things as you:

```
for each player:
  for each item that player had listed:
    announce item
    let c = count how many people had written item (count by raising hands on cams or in participants view?)
    if c > 1
      each player who had it written awards themselves c points    
```
##### Example of play, continued:

* Cesar: "London Eye... anyone?"
* On video for gallery view, all 3 raise their hands (or on participants view)
* Cesar: "great, give yourself 3 points, everyone!"
* Cesar: "next... big ben!  anyone?"
* On video, only Cesar and Manolito raise their hands
* Cesar: "Whaaat, BIG BEN, Adalberto!"
* Adalberto: "It's nothing special I've seen it"
* Cesar: "exactly.  you went and saw it"
* Cesar: "... 2 points to me and adalberto"
* ... (cesar finishes scoring his other words.  0 points in both cases)
* Adalberto: "Tower of london?  Yay 3 points..."
* Adalberto: "London Eye - we already had that one... Madame Tussauds, the waxworks place?"
* Manolito: "No.  That place is creepy"
* Adalberto: "Cesar?  Madame Tussauds?"
* Cesar: "no!  you've heard my four words already!"
* Adalberto: "0 points.  ... Buckingham Palace!  no?  0 points.  I've got 6 points! Manolito what's left?"
* Manolito: "So I had london eye (3) , tower of london (2), big ben (2 points, thanks for nothing adalberto)..."
* Manolito: "... and trafalgar square! We went there last week, people!"

Some possible topics to get you started: 

* famous food from the UK
* wild animals
* Names of concepts or structures from fundamentals
* famous websites

Misc: 
This could benefit from  a simple app/spreadsheet to aid quick scoring

See also: [Hive Mind (BGG)](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/201308/hive-mind)

Variant: play some variant rounds where players are looking for uncommon items (see tv game "Pointless") which no-one else has chosen.  So that nonsense isn't offered, at least one other player has to agree that the proferred answer IS in fact of the given category.


# Possibilities to elaborate


### jackbox games

* talent shows - a music performance.  If someone can play an instrument or can sing, perhaps they'd give us a performance.


# To try / needs adaptation
* zip zap boing - using gallery view?  "zip zap... Zoom (TM)"?  (sorry)

* [Snake Oil](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/113289/snake-oil) / [The Big Idea](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/696/big-idea) (neill has [a tool to generate client and cards](https://nbogie.github.io/salesman/) for this game.
* Wits & Wagers - needs adaptation & simple app for placing bets.  Small-group quick voice comms is the hard part - Breakout room to discuss could work but it's a bit clunky for the tempo, and we really want to keep everyone together rather than suddenly dampen the vibe.  Could accomodate big groups.  Game show feel.

* [mastermind](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2392/mastermind): logical thinking.  probably smaller group 6-8?, teams.  Slow, cerebral, potentially exclusive.  Good practice in relatively similar-ability teams explaining to each other the rules, and the logic, etc. (e.g. add a rule: your entire team must be able agree before you take a move. (Or better, a randomly picked player from your team must explain the logic of your move)).

* "CYF jeopardy": just jeopardy with tech questions: "a programming language that can run in the web browser": "What is JavaScript?"

* [codenames](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames) / [codenames pictures](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/198773/codenames-pictures): needs a fixed webcam on the pictures, or web version.  Better to know your team-mates. Shared cultural references also help.  Worth experimenting, as it's a hugely popular modern game.  Slower, more cerebral. Would work as a remote games-night social, perhaps.

* spit it out
* balderdash (difficult)
* concept: needs online impl
### Einstein five-house puzzle, or similar

Here as a placeholder for logic puzzles.  Find some easier ones to start with.

I have doubts about this one for mixed-ability class. 

Main problem is how to prevent quarterbacking.  One or two minds will dominate and that will snowball.

In a similar ability group, makes for good practice explaining your logic to each other.

Breakout rooms of suitable sizes.  Don't assign competitively (one group will finish much faster than the other - demoralising).

Also, these are much easier once you've learned how to do them.

"
In a street there are five houses, painted five different colours. In each house lives a person of different nationality.
These five home-owners each drink a different kind of beverage, smoke different brand of cigar and keep a different pet.

2. The Swedish man keeps dogs as pets.
3. The Danish man drinks tea.
4. The Green house is next to, and on the left of the White house.
5. The owner of the Green house drinks coffee.
6. The person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.
