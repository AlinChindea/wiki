title: Effective Organisation on Slack
---

## Brief

In this guide, I want to give some high level tips about how to communicate and organise effectively on Slack.

Most of this document is what I’ve gleaned from digital organising with other code schools and activist organisations.

## Problems

Using Slack as an organisational tool has several problems

- People do not check Slack enough
  - Unless you work for a company that uses Slack extensively, it’s very easy to forget that Slack exists
  - The longer people don’t check the Slack, the harder it is to catch up
- Messages are easily sent off screen so they get missed
  - Important messages are quickly sent off the first scroll of the page if there are lots of people talking
- It’s hard to tell the difference between an important message and people chatting
- Everyone’s messages have the same importance
  - There’s no way to tell who is in charge

However, I’ve noticed a few tricks that can help us cut through the noise.

## Rules of Slack Organisation

1. **Every message is a project**

When you’re writing a message you should always have in mind the information you’re trying to convey and the goals you’re trying to achieve with the message.

2. **The importance of the message is directly proportional to how much time you spend creating it**

People respond better when they know that the person sending the message has spent time creating it. The respect goes two ways.

3. **Fewer, better crafted messages**

It is very easy to swamp Slack channels with requests. You shouldn’t send multiple requests within a few hours, especially if they are low quality.

## Building a Slack Request

Every message should, at a glance, be able to answer these questions

1. Who is the message for?
2. What needs to be done?
3. How do I get involved?

Let’s imagine we have an urgent request to get volunteers to help with approving applicants.

Here is an example of a poorly made Slack Request:

<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Code-Your0.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

Here is an example of a better Slack Request:

<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Code-Your1.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert3">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

Here is an example of a better, very urgent Slack Request:

<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/Code-Your2.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

What does the second message do better than the first?

- Formatting
  - Splitting the request out onto separate lines help to break up the post
  - Using bold to highlight the most important parts of the request to get people understand the request quickly.
- Thread
  - By tagging relevant people in the thread (instead of into the post itself) it encourages people to respond in the thread.
- Emojis
  - Whilst you shouldn’t use for every request. A line of emojis at the top of the request can help to break the message apart from others in the chat log.
- Physical space
  - The amount of screen real estate that the message takes up should be in line with how important the message is
- Short messaging
  - There’s no point in using long, run on sentences in a Slack message. Nobody will read it. Always be succinct.
