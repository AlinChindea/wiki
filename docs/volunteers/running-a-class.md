## Activity Breakdown

### Arrange Classroom

**What is this?**

Before every class we need to layout the classroom so that it's ready for the day. This ussually means arranging the classroom into small groups of 4 or 5 per table so that people can work together easily.

**Who runs this?**

It is normally the responsibility of the students to make sure the classroom is ready for class.

**Why do we do this?**

We strongly believe that 'We Are All Crew' and it is important that the students take an active role in preparing for class.

### Energisers

**What is this?**

Energisers are important to help break the ice at the begining of each day and allow our volunteers and students to get to know each other.

In this afternoon, this helps to pick up the mood after lunch and get people ready to learn.
