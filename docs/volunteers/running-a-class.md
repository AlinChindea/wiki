## Activity Breakdown

### Arrange Classroom

**What is this?**

Before every class we need to layout the classroom so that it's ready for the day. This ussually means arranging the classroom into small groups of 4 or 5 per table so that people can work together easily.

It is normally the responsibility of the students to make sure the classroom is ready for class.

**Why do we do this?**

We strongly believe that 'We Are All Crew' and it is important that the students take an active role in preparing for class.

### Energisers
