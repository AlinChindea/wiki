## Activity Breakdown

### Arrange Classroom

**What is this?**

Before every class we need to layout the classroom so that it's ready for the day. This ussually means arranging the classroom into small groups of 4 or 5 per table so that people can work together easily.

**Who runs this?**

It is normally the responsibility of the students to make sure the classroom is ready for class.

**Why do we do this?**

We strongly believe that 'We Are All Crew' and it is important that the students take an active role in preparing for class.

### Energisers

**What is this?**

Energisers are short - often physical - games that are used to energise our student to be ready for the day. They will normally take 10-15 minutes to run and are fairly informal in structure.

**Who runs this?**

Usually a Personal Development volunteer will run the energisers but it can be run by anyone

**Why do we do this?**

Energisers are important to help break the ice at the beginning of each day and allow our volunteers and students to get to know each other.

In this afternoon, this helps to pick up the mood after lunch and get people ready to learn.

### Student Retrospective

**What is this?**

At the start of each day we have our students look back on the weeks homework and discuss what when well and what they struggled with.

**Who runs this?**

**Why do we do this?**

As well as simulating a real life work environment it is helpful for the students to understand that they are not alone in not understanding the homework. They will all - at different times - struggle with the homework and so they should be open to sharing their difficulties.

### Volunteer Kick-off

**What is this?**

At the beginning of each day it is important that all of our volunteers understand the objectives of the day. This meeting ussually includes

- Introducing new volunteers to the group
- Discussing what will be taught in todays lesson
- Students we should be giving particular help to
- Thanking the volunteers for attending!

**Who runs this?**

The Class Coordinator will normally chair the kick off but anyway can offer agenda points throughout the meeting.

**Why do we do this?**

It is important at CodeYourFuture for all volunteers to feel engaged throughout the day and this starts with introductions. Too often, we are so excited to start teaching we forget to make our volunteers feel welcome and appreciated at the start of the day. This really does set the basis for the day and helps grow our community.

### Morning Teaching
