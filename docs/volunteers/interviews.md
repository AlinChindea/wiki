title: Student Interviews
---

Before every class we make sure to interview our potential students as a final step before acceptence on to the course.

### Aims

- Get to the know the students
  - This is the first time we've ever met them! We have to be sure we can work with them for the next eight months
- Assess that the students have retained the knowledge then learnt in the previous steps
  - We should also confirm that the students actually did the work themselves
- Assess the students have a good level of spoken English
  - Students can get help from friends and family for written work

## Interview Days

Interview days generally run the whole day and require a large number of both technical and non-technical volunteers.

As students arrive they should be taken to a quiet space with one technical volunteer (someone who understands code) and one non-technical volunteer.

Together they should complete this form:

[Student Interview Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ps6CEPPr_50hBmmXBPKwogAGRwnGnJr7GccUekdHqjM/edit)
(The class coordinator should duplicate this form for each Class)

Aim to be as objective and fair as possible. Be mindful of your biases. If in doubt, record more information than you think is neccessary.
