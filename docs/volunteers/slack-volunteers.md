## Introduction

[Slack](https://slack.com/) is a workplace environment for team communication.
It has many advantages compared to traditional email and instant messaging, but it should not be confused with them.
People do not get instant notifications unless they are tagged and have slack downloaded on their phones.
Most tech companies use it at work, which offers an opportunity for CYF trainers to be available (as they can switch among workplaces).

Slack should be kept tidy and organised to maximise its usefulness.

## Fundamentals

- Use threaded communication (replies to a topic should always be in a thread)
- Edit your entries instead of adding extra information that you forgot in a message
- Learn to tag people and groups (every class is in a user group)
- Tag people only when you need their attention
- Use plain text names instead of tags if you donâ€™t require a response from people
- Start a new thread if you are talking about a completely different topic
- Know what channels to use to make posts and ask for questions

## Student communication

- Learn to use thumbs up to confirm announcement has been read
- Communicate in advance if you want to work with another classmate and specify time and topic (you can tag the class)
- Ensure you reply in threads to communication and tag relevant people to get their attention to arrange on working together
- Use the student channel for organisation and non-class related discussion
- Start calls in the channel so that other students can join you.
  Ensure that it is titled with clear description of what are you working on
- Delete any failed group calls to keep the channel clear
- Inform the class as soon as possible if you are not planning to come or able to come to class

## Volunteer communication

- Make sure to tag students and graduates for events and create user groups for core volunteers
- Share social meetings and pictures in public channels
- Summarise meetings in minutes using assigned shared document
