## Tools

We recommend using [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for online classes because

- It suppurts breakout rooms that are useful for group tasks.
- It is relatively cheap - Â£14 per host per month
- It supports very large numbers of attendees

We suggest that everyone [downloads the client now](https://zoom.us/download).

## Setup

Please follow the instructions for pre-class setup [here](/volunteers/online-teaching-settings).
