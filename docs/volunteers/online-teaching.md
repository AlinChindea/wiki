## Zoom Setup

We recommend using [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for online classes because

- It supports breakout rooms that are useful for group tasks.
- It supports very large numbers of attendees

We suggest that everyone [downloads the client now](https://zoom.us/download).

**Please follow the instructions for pre-class setup [here](/volunteers/online-teaching-config).**

## Classes

Broadly, the setup of our class rooms is the same as our physical classroom.

Each classroom room should have no more than 25 students and then enough breakout rooms to accommodate 3 -4 students per room. Each breakout room should have a teaching assistant

### Teacher Communication

We recommend you use slack - make and use a custom channel or group chat especially to communicate between teachers not in the same call. This is important so messages don't get lost and all teachers are kept in the loop.

For teachers and TAs in the same virtual classroom you can also:

- Audio right in the main room (not if we split into two classrooms)
- Use a teachers' breakout room
- Use DMs in Zoom chat

### Student Communication

Students should be directed to ask questions in the Slack Channel. We suggest creating a new thread for each teaching section where all questions should be asked. It is the responsibility of one Teaching Assistant to keep a track of questions.
