## Zoom Setup

We recommend using [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for online classes because

- It supports breakout rooms that are useful for group tasks.
- It supports very large numbers of attendees

We suggest that everyone [downloads the client now](https://zoom.us/download).

**Please follow the instructions for pre-class setup [here](/volunteers/online-teaching-config).**

## Classes

Broadly, the setup of our class rooms is the same as our physical classroom. This means as closely as possible it should [keep to the structure of our physical classes as outlined hre](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/volunteers/running-a-class).

Each classroom room should have no more than 25 students and then enough breakout rooms to accommodate 3-4 students per room. Each breakout room should have a teaching assistant who is there to help and mentor the students during the exercise.

### Classroom Setup

It is the responsibility of the Assistant Lead teacher to `Host` the Online Classrooms and make sure the Zoom space is setup correctly for learning. This will involve:

- Making sure all the students can access the class correctly
- Assign all students and volunteers to the breakout rooms that they'll be in for the day
- Making all classroom participants `co-hosts` so they can move themselves to and from breakout rooms at their will
- Enable `simultaneous screen share` by clicking `^` next to their own share button

## Communication in Class

### Communication between Teachers

We recommend you use slack - make and use a custom channel or group chat especially to communicate between teachers not in the same call. This is important so messages don't get lost and all teachers are kept in the loop.

For teachers and TAs in the same virtual classroom you can also:

- Audio right in the main room (not if we split into two classrooms)
- Use a teachers' breakout room
- Use DMs in Zoom chat

### Communication between Students

Students should be directed to ask questions in the Slack Channel. We suggest creating a new thread for each teaching section where all questions should be asked. It is the responsibility of one Teaching Assistant to keep a track of questions.

## Classroom Roles

#### Coordinator

- Make sure the teachers understand the content for the week
- Debug technical problems the students are having
- As students and volunteers join, confirm that they're video and audio is working

#### Lead Teacher

- Lead teaching sessions and delvier content
- Introduce homework for the week to the class

#### Assistant Lead Teacher

- Host and administer the video call
  - Start the video call
  - Mute noisy people who are not speaking
  - Bring questions to the teachers attention
  - Assign people to Breakout rooms
- Manage the timing for the day
  - Make sure that parts of the lesson start and finish on time.
- Answer calls for help from breakout room

#### Assistant Teachers

- Guide exercises in the breakout rooms
- Answer questions the students have
- Debug students code as they are programming
- Moderate and guide the students discussions during exercises

#### Energiser

- Coordinate the morning and afternoon energisers

## Tips & Techniques

- We recommend using `Gallery` mode to view all of the students at once. You change this from the top right of your school

## Student Training

Some rough ideas for what might be helpful to do in-person or pre-class. None of this is crucial but will potentially make a big difference for those who are less-tech-savvy

- Get the desktop client installed if they're on a slow laptop - it seems to be more performant.
  - The web client has sufficient functionality for students to participate in a class, so this is not a must.
- Demonstrate how to initiate screen-share etc in classroom (and any other aspects of zoom that can't be presented BY zoom).
- Check and debug mic/webcam issues (inc quality) (even if we think we're not using camera).
  - Commonly, may be accidentally disabled in browser for zoom.us.
- Have everyone do one test screenshare, checking performance
- Practice "raise hands" and other feedback mechanism
- Practice some breakout room skills, and etiquette
  re-joining your breakout room if you accidentally leave, or if the call drops
- Discuss muting etiquette
- Alert to issues of candid webcam mistakes!
- Health-check slow laptops. Test screensharing from them (I think choppy audio and video is often CPU before it is network). Ensure students aren't running more than they need to.
- learn how to "ask host for help" from a breakout room
- Engage some students who already know how to do this to assist in demonstrating to their colleagues.
  - Students can also use [this guide](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360031043292-Testing-Computer-or-Device-Audio) to test their audio/video

## Training calls

We use zoom training calls to up-skill our volunteers and students. You can find details here:
