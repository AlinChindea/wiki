## Zoom Setup

We recommend using [Zoom](https://zoom.us) for online classes because

- It supports breakout rooms that are useful for group tasks.
- It supports very large numbers of attendees

We suggest that everyone [downloads the client now](https://zoom.us/download).

**Zoom account owners should follow the instructions for pre-class setup [here](/volunteers/online-teaching-config).**

## Classes

Broadly, the setup of our class rooms is the same as our physical classroom. This means as closely as possible it should [keep to the structure of our physical classes as outlined hre](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/volunteers/running-a-class).

Each classroom room should have no more than 25 students and then enough breakout rooms to accommodate 3-4 students per room. Each breakout room should have a teaching assistant who is there to help and mentor the students during the exercise.

### Classroom Setup

It is the responsibility of the Assistant Lead teacher to `Host` the Online Classrooms and make sure the Zoom space is setup correctly for learning. This will involve:

- Making sure all the students can access the class correctly
- Assign all students and volunteers to the breakout rooms that they'll be in for the day
- Making all classroom participants `co-hosts` so they can move themselves to and from breakout rooms at their will
- Enable `simultaneous screen share` by clicking `^` next to their own share button

## Communication in Class

### Communication between Teachers

We recommend you use slack - make and use a custom channel or group chat especially to communicate between teachers not in the same call. This is important so messages don't get lost and all teachers are kept in the loop.

London, for example, will use [#london-teachers-during-class](https://app.slack.com/client/T2H71EFLK/C0109KRLYTS/thread/C010D1C41K2-1584699383.012200)

For teachers and TAs in the same virtual classroom you can also use:

- Audio in the main room!  Simple works!
- A dedicated breakout room for teachers' & TAs - normally the main room is fine

### Communication between Students

Students should be directed to ask questions in the Slack Channel. We suggest creating a new thread for each teaching section where all questions should be asked. It is the responsibility of one Teaching Assistant to keep a track of questions.

## Classroom Roles

  - Bring important questions to the teacher's attention
  - Assign people to Breakout rooms

  - Make sure that parts of the lesson start and finish on time.
- Answer calls for help from breakout room

## Tips & Techniques

- Above all else remember that you are _"You are fighting against boredom and disengagement"_ when teaching online. It is so easy for student to stop listening when they're not physically in the room.
- Enforce all students to have their webcams on - this helps with keeping the students engaged
- We recommend using `Gallery` mode to view all of the students at once. You change this from the top right of your school
- Use _Popcorning_ when asking an open question
  - This technique is where a student gives an answer and then selects another to give their answer.
  - This helps keep students engaged
- Use emoji's tell if students don't understand something
  - For example in this Slack post the teacher uses a confused emoji to tell if some students don't understand the question
  - Its important that you add the emoji first yourself so that it's easy for students

- Use the webcam to your advantage
  - To tell if students are understanding ask them to nod or shake their head to tell you the answer
  - This introduces some student accountability
