In London, there are Education, Development and Outreach teams.
In Scotland, we are currently working towards delineating tasks like this but for the moment we have two teams: an Education team and a team dealing together with Development and Outreach.

The reason we have a joint Development and Outreach Team, currently, is mainly because both teams have a stake in forging relationships to help find graduates employment.

In Scotland, because we only have one member of staff, we also have the need for volunteers to help generally with Operational and Administrative tasks.
We are always trying to consolidate and grow our impact.
Developing ideas and strategies aimed towards this, though, can be time-and-resource-heavy.
Therefore, we appreciate people who are willing to help us in this type of role and contribute to planning around funding, organisation and our vision for the future.

Here are general tasks to be fulfilled by respective Education, Outreach and Personal Development Teams:
