title: Module leads

Mentors can volunteer as module leads, where they lead a module (e.g. JavaScript I).
Module leads do not necessarily need to be an expert in the subject or even be the one doing the teaching — their main role is ensuring the module runs.
It is also possible to have multiple mentor leads for a single module to share the responsibilities.

The responsibilities and duties of a module lead are listed below.

## Responsibilities

- Lead mentors are responsible for ensuring the following tasks are completed to ensure the module runs smoothly
- Resources such as quizzes may already exist for most modules. In such cases these need to be reviewed/updated

## Prep

- Syllabus reviewed and tested for clarity and accuracy. A full run-through of exercises should be completed to catch any broken code
- A progress tracker should be completed for the students to track their own learning progress
- A quiz should be created to be given to students at the end of the module
- Revision material should be created for the students to do on their own during revision week
- Group projects or similar exercises should be arranged to teach soft skills, group work, Git, or similar skills during revision week

## Running the class

- Identify who will be teaching what during each week and make sure they understand the material they are teaching
- Make sure there are enough mentors to run the class each week (at least 3)
- Show up 30 minutes before class to open Collaborate, arrange desks and make sure the class can start on time
- Make sure food is available at lunch
- Make sure the course runs to time — that lunch breaks happen at appropriate times, that it ends on time, that group presentations are kept to time, etc.
- Run a retrospective on the final session of the module
- Compile the top outcomes of the retrospective and determine actions to take. Share with mentors and students
- Make sure learning outcomes are achieved during the class. If a teacher is floundering or a concept explanation didn't land, make sure it is revisited
