## Introduction

The graduation projects are real-life projects that we attempt to pair with an external organisation such as another [NGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization).
For example, in the first Glasgow cohort students built an app for a sustainable food map of Glasgow in collaboration with [Kinning Park Complex](https://www.kinningparkcomplex.org/), and a Glasgow welcome pack in collaboration with [Refuweegee](https://www.refuweegee.co.uk/).

The purpose of the graduation project is to get you working in an environment that is similar to the workplace.
This will get you familiar with various methodologies that real world software teams work in, such as:

- [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) (as opposed to a [waterfall model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model))
- Working in a [scrum framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) which involves:
  - A [product owner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_owner), [scrum master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Scrum_master) and development team
  - A daily stand-up
